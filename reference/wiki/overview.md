# Phenol Plant — Process Overview

**Plant:** PTT Phenol Company Limited (PPCL) — **Train II**  
**Location:** Hemaraj Eastern Industrial Estate, Map Ta Phut, Rayong, Thailand  
**Licensor:** UOP (Universal Oil Products) | **Engineer:** POSCO Engineering | **Project No.:** 120117  
**Reference:** [[project]]

## Plant Objective

Produce high-purity **Phenol (C₆H₅OH)** and co-product **Acetone (CH₃COCH₃)** from **Benzene (C₆H₆)** and **Propylene (C₃H₆)** feedstocks via the **Hock Process (Cumene Process)**.

## Chemistry

### Overall Reaction

```
C₆H₆  +  C₃H₆  →  C₆H₅OH  +  CH₃COCH₃
Benzene + Propylene → Phenol + Acetone
```

Phenol and Acetone are produced in an approximately **1:0.62 mass ratio** (stoichiometric).

### Step-by-Step Chemistry

**Step 1 — Alkylation** [[units/alkylation]]
```
C₆H₆  +  C₃H₆  →  C₆H₅CH(CH₃)₂
Benzene + Propylene → Cumene (Isopropylbenzene)
```
- Catalyst: Zeolite (modern plants) or AlCl₃/BF₃ (older plants)
- Side products: Diisopropylbenzene (DIPB), Polyisopropylbenzene (PIPB)
- DIPB is transalkylated back to Cumene to improve yield

**Step 2 — Oxidation** [[units/oxidation]]
```
C₆H₅CH(CH₃)₂  +  O₂  →  C₆H₅C(CH₃)₂OOH
Cumene + Air/O₂ → Cumene Hydroperoxide (CHP)
```
- Liquid-phase, non-catalytic, air oxidation
- Temperature ~110–130°C; CHP concentration typically 20–35 wt%
- Side products: Alpha-Methylstyrene (AMS), Acetophenone, DMBA
- CHP is a **peroxide — thermally unstable above ~100°C** [[hazards/cumene-hydroperoxide]]

**Step 3 — Cleavage / Decomposition** [[units/cleavage]]
```
C₆H₅C(CH₃)₂OOH  →  C₆H₅OH  +  CH₃COCH₃
CHP → Phenol + Acetone
```
- Acid-catalyzed (dilute H₂SO₄ or ion exchange resin)
- Highly exothermic — precise temperature and residence time control critical
- By-products: AMS, Acetophenone, Cumene (unreacted), Hydroxyacetone

**Step 4 — Distillation / Purification** [[units/distillation]]
- Neutralization of acid catalyst
- Multi-column distillation train:
  - Acetone column: Crude acetone → Refined acetone
  - Cumene column: Recycle cumene and AMS
  - Phenol column: Crude phenol → Refined phenol
  - Heavy ends: Tar, Acetophenone, Bisphenol-A precursors

## Process Sections Summary

| Code | Section | PPCL Name | Purpose | Key Hazard |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| ALKY | Alkylation | *(TBC)* | Make Cumene | High-pressure, flammable hydrocarbons |
| OXI | Oxidation | Oxidation Section | Make CHP | Peroxide accumulation, thermal runaway |
| CDN | Concentration + Decomposition + Neutralization | CDN Section | Concentrate CHP → Make Phenol + Acetone → Neutralize | Exothermic decomposition, thermal runaway, acid |
| DIST | Distillation | Fractionation + Phenol Recovery | Purify products | Flammable vapors, phenol skin absorption |
| UT | Utilities | Utilities | Steam, cooling water, N₂, instrument air | — |
| ETP | Effluent Treatment | ETP | Treat phenolic wastewater | Phenol toxicity |

**Plant-specific note:** PPCL uses "CDN" for the combined Concentration + Decomposition + Neutralization section. This is a UOP-specific process design. See [[units/cdn]] for full plant data.

## Critical Process Constraints

1. **CHP Concentration (Oxidation)**: Must not exceed ~35 wt% — above this, thermal decomposition risk increases sharply. See [[hazards/cumene-hydroperoxide]]
2. **Cleavage Temperature**: Strictly controlled — runaway decomposition if temperature rises uncontrolled
3. **Phenol Handling**: Significant skin absorption hazard — refer to [[hazards/phenol]]
4. **Wastewater**: Phenolic water must be treated before discharge — [[units/etp]] *(pending)*
