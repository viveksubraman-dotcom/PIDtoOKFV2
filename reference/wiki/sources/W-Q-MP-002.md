## Document Purpose

Establishes the GC Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) — a qualitative risk assessment tool used consistently across PTTGC and subsidiaries. The RAM is applied to Process Hazard Analysis (PHA/HAZOP), Incident Investigation, RCM, RBI, SIF, Corrective Maintenance, OT Cyber Security, and other operational risk processes.

## Key Findings for HAZOP

### RAM Structure
- **5×5 matrix**: 5 Likelihood levels × 5 Consequence severity levels
- **4 Consequence categories (PEES)**: People, Environment, Economic, Social
- **Risk rankings**: Very Low (green) → Low (yellow) → Medium (orange) → High (red) → Extreme (dark red)
- For HAZOP: Section 6.2.1.3.1 — "RAM for Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)" governs

### Risk Assessment Process (4 steps)
1. Identify potential Consequences
2. Estimate Severity of each Consequence (1–5 per PEES category)
3. Estimate Likelihood (1–5)
4. Determine Risk Rating from matrix

### Two-Stage HAZOP Risk Assessment
Consistent with P-(Q-MP)-OEMS-005 §6.5.2:
- **Initial Risk** = Severity × Likelihood WITHOUT safeguards
- **Mitigated Risk** = Severity FIXED (never changes) × Likelihood re-evaluated WITH safeguards

### Thai Regulation (DIW) Note
For PHA required to comply with Thai DIW regulation:
- 4×4 RAM applies: Consequence (1)–(4), Likelihood "Improbable (1)" to "Likely (4)"
- Risk ranks: Very Low to High (no "Extreme" level in DIW matrix)

### Action Thresholds
| Risk Level | Action Required |
|-----------|----------------|
| Extreme | Serious risk — action & risk reduction plan immediately |
| High | Unacceptable risk — action & risk reduction plan immediately |
| Medium | Medium risk — require risk reduction plan |
| Low | Acceptable risk — require review of control plan |
| Very Low | Very low risk |
