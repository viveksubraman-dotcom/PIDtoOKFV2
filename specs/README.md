# System Specifications & SDD Registry (`specs/`)

This directory serves as the **Single Source of Truth** for all formal specifications, baseline reverse-engineering documents, feature proposals, and implementation progress tracking under the **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** mandate.

## SDD Governance & Core Principles

All work in this repository is governed by the rules codified in [`_agents/rules/`](../_agents/rules/):

1. **Spec First, Code Second:** Code is a downstream artifact derived from specifications. Direct code changes without an approved specification and step-by-step implementation plan are strictly prohibited ([`_agents/rules/spec_driven_development.md`](../_agents/rules/spec_driven_development.md)).
2. **Brownfield Baseline First:** When modifying existing systems, reverse-engineer and document the "as-is" state under `specs/baseline/` before authoring feature changes.
3. **Mandatory Testing at Every Step:** Every implementation step must define and implement:
   - **Deterministic Unit Tests:** Happy paths, boundary conditions, error handling.
   - **Generative Property-Based Tests (PBT):** Mathematical and logical invariants tested across generative input spaces (e.g., `fast-check` in TS, `hypothesis` in Python).
4. **Runtime Separation of Responsibilities:**
   - **Conversational AI Agents & Tool Registries:** Built with official `google-adk` and deployed to the **Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform (`agent_runtime`)** ([`_agents/rules/google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md`](../_agents/rules/google_adk_and_agent_runtime.md)).
   - **Web Applications, API Proxies & Streaming Gateways:** Hosted on **Google Cloud Run (`cloud_run`)** ([`_agents/rules/devops_security_and_quality_standards.md`](../_agents/rules/devops_security_and_quality_standards.md)).
5. **Model-Driven Reasoning:** Agent intent routing and tool execution are strictly cognitive and model-driven; keyword heuristics, regex routing, and hardcoded fallback arrays are strictly forbidden.
6. **Live Environment Agent Evaluation:** Trajectory fidelity and tool selection precision ($\ge 95\%$) are continuously evaluated against the live environment via `agents-cli eval`.
7. **Mandatory Root Cause Investigation & Zero Quick-Patch Standard:** When tests or evals fail, developers/agents must execute the 4-step RCA protocol. Zero quick fixes, mockups, regex patches, or assertion weakening ([`_agents/rules/root_cause_investigation_and_zero_quick_patch.md`](../_agents/rules/root_cause_investigation_and_zero_quick_patch.md)).
8. **Zero Spec Drift:** Synchronize specification files in `specs/` whenever code contracts or behaviors change.
9. **Living Plan Progress Tracking:** Continuous execution reports, test verification metrics, and milestone statuses are maintained under `specs/plan/`.

## Active Specifications Registry

### 1. Baseline Specifications ([`specs/baseline/`](./baseline/))
- [`BASELINE-20260922-EXTRACTER-AGENT-SYSTEM`](./baseline/system-overview.md): Full baseline architecture, immutable reference data sources, environment parameters, and core invariants.

### 2. Feature Specifications ([`specs/features/`](./features/))
- [`SPEC-20260922-OKF-EXTRACTER-AGENT`](./features/SPEC-20260922-OKF-EXTRACTER-AGENT.md): Autonomous OKF Extracter Agent on Google ADK, Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform, PDF processing, and GCS publication.

### 3. Plan Progress Reports ([`specs/plan/`](./plan/))
- [`PROGRESS_REPORT_20260922`](./plan/PROGRESS_REPORT_20260922.md): Implementation milestone tracking, unit & property-based test verification, and CodeMender security audit.
