## Methodology Notes

- **9-step method**: per SG-(Q-MP)-014 §5.3.3 — see full detail at [[hazop/methodology]]
- **Guideword set**: Table 6.1 of SG-(Q-MP)-014 — 14 parameters × applicable guidewords — see [[hazop/methodology]]
- **Initial risk** = Severity × Likelihood WITHOUT safeguards — Severity is fixed at this stage
- **Mitigated risk** = Likelihood re-assessed WITH IPL-qualified safeguards — Severity never changes
- **Acceptable risk for GC** = Low or Very Low; Mitigated risk ≥ Medium → must generate recommendation
- **IPL credit**: Active (Table 6.4) and Passive (Table 6.5) from SG-(Q-MP)-014 — see [[hazop/methodology]]
- **RAM**: [[hazop/risk-matrix]] (W-(Q-MP)-002 §6.2.1.3.1) governs all rankings
- **Full record approach**: every deviation must be documented; if no credible cause, state "N/A — no credible cause"

## Session Management — Facilitation Guidance

> Source: [[sources/hazop-leadership-training-ch6]]

### Decision-Making Approach
Preferred approach: **Consensus** — team more committed to conclusions, fewer confrontations, no corridor politicking. Leader may use direct decision (levels 1–2) when the team is stuck or when procedural/ground-rule matters arise, but risk-ranking and recommendation decisions should always be consensus.

### HAZOP Ground Rules (to be agreed at first session)

**Core rules (Leader proposes; team helps finalize):**
1. Start on time and end on time
2. Take breaks regularly — maintain team energy
3. All ideas are worthy — no bad ideas
4. Safe environment — no personal attacks
5. Everyone contributes
6. **Do not design solutions in the HAZOP meeting** — raise a recommendation; solve it outside
7. Take conflicts outside the workshop
8. Phones on silent / vibrate / off
9. Advise of any absence in advance

**Supplementary rules:**
1. Diversity is good
2. Present your view but avoid arguing for it
3. Listen to others and look for compromise
4. Do not change your view simply to avoid conflict

### Progressive Leader Role (per session)
| Phase | Role | Key Behavior |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Session 1 opening | **Trainer** | Train team, let group create ground rules, phrase own contributions as questions |
| Early sessions | **Team Builder** | Go around room on causes; direct questions to specific expertise; maintain safe environment |
| Normal node analysis | **Facilitator** | Stay neutral; refer ideas to team not self; use parking lot; deal with difficult personalities |
| After node / report | **Editor** | Quality-check worksheet entries and recommendations |

## Anti-Bias Declaration

> ⚠️ **No previous HAZOP reports have been ingested into this wiki.** This study is conducted independently. No prior worksheets, revalidation reports, or recommendation registers are present in `raw/`. See HAZOP Anti-Bias Rule in CLAUDE.md.

## Node Status Register

> Nodes to be defined once expert-marked P&IDs are provided. CDN P&IDs 0002–0023 are available in `raw/pid/`. An experienced engineer should mark node boundaries on these drawings before node analysis begins.

| CDN-N06 | (markup "Node 23-06" — Cumene Quench Drum area, Dwg 0006) | 0006 | Pending — markup received | — |

> **Node numbering note:** the engineer's markup labels nodes "Node 23-0x" (23 = CDN drawing series). Filed in the wiki as `CDN-N0x` per the skill's `<unit>-N<nn>` schema. The "Node 23-02.pdf" markup (supplied 2026-06-17) shows 23-01/02/03/05/06; the "Node 23-03.pdf" markup (supplied 2026-06-18, green highlight across Dwg 0007/0007A/0008/0009/0012/0012A) defines **CDN-N03**. **23-02** and **23-03** have been worked (preliminary). Recommend filing both markups in `raw/pid/` for the record.
